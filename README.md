# K40-Gantry

![Gantry V1](https://github.com/vr6syncro/K40-Gantry/blob/main/Gantry_v1.png)

This is a Gantry for the K40 Laser Tool. It works for the original and the big version where u move the electric somewhere else and use the complete case.

The Download can be found here: https://github.com/vr6syncro/K40-Gantry/releases

For more information about the Gantry Mod in the original K40 Case see https://K40.tech

The Case is mostly a remix from Adam Mac with some changes for my needs.
The original Case can be found under: https://grabcad.com/library/k40-co2-laser-cutter-engraver-cnc-1
